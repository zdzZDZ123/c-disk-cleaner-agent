# This file makes the 'ui' directory a Python package.
# You can add imports here if needed for the package.

# To allow running the UI with `python -m ui`,
# we can import the main app function or class here if desired,
# or rely on __main__.py to handle the execution.

# For simplicity and to ensure __main__.py is the entry point for `python -m ui`,
# we can leave this file minimal or add a simple print statement for debugging if necessary.

# print("ui package initialized") # Optional: for debugging

# If you want to expose the App class directly when importing the ui package:
# from .app import App
